          An integrated automation solution links the systems and applications
          in one console, builds a unified knowledge base that delivers relevant
          data in real time, and automatically sets up and kicks off processes
          for an efficient post-call wrap-up.

          Agents are freed from having to process repetitive, manual tasks and
          can focus on developing their customer-centric skills. Unlike many
          first generation RPA tools, which focus primarily on the design of
          robots, the UiPath platform was designed to meet the deployment,
          management, security, reporting, integration, and scalability
          requirements of today’s global enterprises. Our AI combines an
          intuitive and easy-to implement enterprise-grade management platform
          that can be deployed in the Cloud. Thus, you can manage all the
          organisation robots from a single console. The agent will safely and
          swiftly update information in different systems simultaneously,
          without having to jump between screens and compromise accuracy.
          Dynamic search options will save time within the conversation, and
          more importantly, will lower the call abandonment rates. The system
          provides the agent with up-sell and cross-sells suggestions in real
          time, creating the opportunity to maximize revenues. At the same time,
          the automatic capture of manual inputs ensures optimization and
          efficiency of the wrap-up work. Data is safely recorded and then
          comprehensively logged, gaining processing accuracy for the
          organization. This frees up time for the agent to take more calls,
          allowing him to develop his customer-centric skills. ​
